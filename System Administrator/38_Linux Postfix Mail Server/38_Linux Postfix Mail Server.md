**xFusionCorp** Industries has planned to set up a common email server in **Stork DC**. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an `IMAP/POP3` server. We would like you to perform the following steps:


- Install and configure postfix on `Stork DC mail server`.

- Create an email account kirsty@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by YchZHRcLkL.

- Set its mail directory to /home/kirsty/Maildir.

- Install and configure dovecot on the same server.
